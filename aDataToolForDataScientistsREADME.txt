PDCA was made popular by W. Edwards Deming.
AKA The Demind Cycle, when PDCA is implemented in an environment for manufactured goods/services, almost certainly quality control requires analysis from linear equations, matrices, and Run/C/P/R/X Charts, depending on the sample Data being analyzed.

Ex. sample ranges, sample means, proportion, # of occurances, or individual Sample Data, corresponds to R, X, P, C, and Run Charts.


This website was envisioned from the perspective that a) quality control inserts 2d/3d arrays, chooses the formulas corresponding to the particular charts, and review data.
