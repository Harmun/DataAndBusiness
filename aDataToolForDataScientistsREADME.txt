PDCA was made popular by W. Edwards Deming.
AKA The Demind Cycle, when PDCA is implemented in an environment for manufactured goods/services, almost certainly quality control requires analysis from linear equations, matrices, and Run/C/P/R/X Charts, depending on the sample Data being analyzed.

Ex. sample ranges, sample means, proportion, # of occurances, or individual Sample Data, corresponds to R, X, P, C, and Run Charts.

The main idea for statistical process control is to ensure the process is statistically stable.

This website was envisioned from the perspective that a) quality control inserts 2d/3d arrays, chooses the formulas corresponding to the particular charts, and reviews lower control / upper control limit, and other indicators provided by the formulas.

Project is under development.
Formulas are currently missing / not included.
